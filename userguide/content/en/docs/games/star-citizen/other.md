**Maximize Your Profits in Star Citizen**

After breaking down a spacecraft and acquiring valuable resources, you hold the power to either upgrade your gear or turn a profit by selling them. However, navigating the vast universe of Star Citizen makes this process more complex, as specific materials can only be traded in certain locations.

Thankfully, this [website](https://sc-trade.tools/best-buyer) simplifies this endeavor. All you need to do is select the material you wish to trade, specify the quantity, and click submit. Instantly, you'll receive information on buyers offering the highest prices for your resources. Keep in mind that stolen resources may limit your options, so be sure to mark the "stolen cargo" box when necessary.

For instance, Trade and Development Division (TDD) is a reliable hub for selling various materials. You can find TDD branches in diverse locations like Stanton/Microtech/New Babbage, Stanton/Crusader/Orison, and more.

If you're dealing with general materials, Admin is your go-to. Look for Admin locations at Stanton/ArcCorp/Baijini Point or Stanton/Microtech/Port Tressler, among others.

When it comes to offloading stolen goods discreetly, No Question Asked is your best bet. Explore locations such as Stanton/CRU L4/CRU-L4 Shallow Fields Station or Stanton/CRU L5/CRU-L5 Shallow Fields Station for lucrative deals without the prying eyes.

### Scan Signal Profiles
**Mastering Radar Scans in Star Citizen**

Navigate the vast expanse of Star Citizen with precision by understanding Rader scans, essential for detecting both asteroids and salvageable entities like derelicts or bulk panels. Analyzing the signal profile empowers you to effortlessly distinguish between asteroids and potential salvage, while also identifying the specific type of derelict vehicle associated with a signal.

When it comes to asteroids, expect a consistent Radar Signal (RS) of 1700 per asteroid. On the other hand, reclaimer-sized panels yield an RS of 2000 per section. For larger salvage prospects like C2 and 890j Derelict Vehicles, their presence is automatically detected at distances well beyond the typical scanning range, streamlining the identification process.

Equip yourself with the knowledge of Rader scans to make informed decisions in the vast reaches of Star Citizen. Whether you're navigating through asteroids or salvaging valuable derelicts, understanding the nuances of signal profiles is key to maximizing your exploration and ensuring a prosperous journey through the stars.



| Signal | Astroids | Panels | Redeemer | Inferno | Titan | C2 | 890 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| IR ||| 10700 | 4500 | 3100 | AutoDetect | AutoDetect |
| CS ||| 8300 | 4800 | 1800 | AutoDetect | AutoDetect |
| RS | N*1700 | N*2000 | 2000 | 1850 | 1700 | AutoDetect | AutoDetect |
