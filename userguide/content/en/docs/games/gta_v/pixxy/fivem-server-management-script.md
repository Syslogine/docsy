# FiveM Server Management Script

This shell script simplifies the management of a FiveM server within a `screen` session on a Linux server. It provides various commands for controlling the server, checking its status, and attaching to its session.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, please ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- **Linux Server**: The script is designed for Linux server environments.
- **Directories**: You must have two directories, "alpine" and "resources," in the same directory as this script.
- **Configuration File**: A configuration file named "server.cfg" is required for the server to function correctly.

## Installation

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Script**: You can download the script from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Syslogine/fivem-screen-manager). Clone the repository or download the script file directly.

2. **Make the Script Executable**: After downloading, navigate to the script's directory and make it executable using the following command:

    ```bash
    chmod +x start_fivem_server.sh
    ```

## Usage

Once you have downloaded and made the script executable, you can use it with the following commands:

### Start the Server

```bash
./start_fivem_server.sh start
```

- Checks if the screen session is already running and starts the server if it's not.
- Creates a detached `screen` session with the specified command from "run.sh."

### Stop the Server

```bash
./start_fivem_server.sh stop
```

- Checks if the screen session is running and stops it gracefully.

### Check Server Status

```bash
./start_fivem_server.sh status
```

- Checks and displays the status of the screen session.

### Attach to Server Session

```bash
./start_fivem_server.sh attach
```

- Attaches to the screen session if it's running, allowing you to interact with the server.
- Detach from the session using `Ctrl+A` followed by `D`.

### Additional Commands

If you provide an invalid command or require usage information, the script will display the usage instructions.

```bash
Usage: ./start_fivem_server.sh {start|stop|status|attach}
```

## Error Handling

The script checks for the existence of required directories and configuration files and provides error messages when necessary. If any of the prerequisites are missing, it will prevent the script from running.
