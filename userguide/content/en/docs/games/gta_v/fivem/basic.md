**CPU**:
- For a single FiveM server instance, you should allocate at least 4-6 CPU cores or vCPUs.
- FiveM is heavily dependent on single-threaded performance, so a modern CPU with high clock speeds and strong per-core performance is recommended.
- Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 5/7 series CPUs are suitable for a single server instance.

**RAM**:
- A single FiveM server instance typically requires 8-16 GB of RAM.
- Higher RAM capacity is recommended if you plan to host a large number of players or resource-intensive custom scripts/mods.

**Storage**:
- Allocate at least 100-200 GB of SSD storage for the game files, server data, and potential growth.
- SSDs provide better I/O performance and reduced latency compared to traditional hard disk drives (HDDs).

**Network**:
- A reliable and high-speed network connection is crucial for online gaming servers.
- Gigabit Ethernet or faster network interfaces are recommended.
- Low latency and consistent bandwidth are important for a smooth gaming experience.

**Player Capacity and Performance**:
- The number of players on your FiveM server can significantly impact performance.
- As the player count increases, the server will require more CPU, RAM, and network resources to handle the increased workload.
- It's essential to monitor resource utilization and adjust the hardware resources accordingly based on your target player capacity.
- As a general guideline, for every 20-30 players, you may need to allocate an additional CPU core or vCPU and 2-4 GB of RAM.

**Operating System and Docker Configuration**:
- Use a stable and efficient operating system like Linux (Ubuntu LTS, CentOS, etc.) or Windows Server, as they are designed for server workloads.
- Ensure that the operating system is properly configured and optimized for Docker containers and gaming server workloads.
- Configure Docker container resources (CPU, RAM, and storage) appropriately to match the server's requirements.

It's important to note that these are general recommendations, and your specific requirements may vary depending on the server configurations, custom scripts/mods, and other factors. It's always a good idea to monitor resource utilization and performance during testing and adjust the hardware resources accordingly.
