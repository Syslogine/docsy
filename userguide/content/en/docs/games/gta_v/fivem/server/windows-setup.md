# Creating a FiveM Server on Windows

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a FiveM server on your Windows PC.

## Prerequisites

- A PC running Windows.
- A copy of Grand Theft Auto V installed.
- Administrative access on your PC.

## Step 1: Downloading FiveM Server Files

1. Visit the FiveM website: [FiveM.net](https://fivem.net/)
2. Download the server files.
3. Extract the downloaded files into a folder where you want your server to be located.

## Step 2: Configuring the Server

1. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the server files.
2. Create a new text document named `server.cfg`.
3. Edit `server.cfg` to configure your server settings. You can find a sample configuration on the FiveM documentation page.

## Step 3: Running the Server

1. Open the folder where your server files are located.
2. Run `FXServer.exe`.
3. Your server should now start. Ensure that your firewall allows incoming and outgoing connections for FiveM.

## Step 4: Connecting to Your Server

1. Open FiveM.
2. Go to the server browser.
3. Search for your server by name.
4. Connect and start playing.

## Additional Configuration

- **Adding Mods**: You can add mods by placing their files in the `resources` folder and configuring them in your `server.cfg`.
- **Server Administration**: Consider using a resource like **txAdmin** for easier server management.

Remember, running a server can require a significant amount of resources depending on the number of players and mods you plan to use.

## Conclusion

Setting up a FiveM server can be a fun way to customize your GTA V experience. Always ensure you respect the game's and FiveM's terms of service when operating your server.
