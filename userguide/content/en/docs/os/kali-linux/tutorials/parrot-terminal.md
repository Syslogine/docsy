Lets download the scripts that will do this for us:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/m4xx101/kali_parrot_terminal.git
```

So now we enter the folder
```bash
cd kali_parrot_terminal/
```

We need to make it executable
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```

And now install with
```bash
./install.sh
```
