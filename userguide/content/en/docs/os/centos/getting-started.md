# Beginner's Guide to CentOS

Welcome to the Beginner's Guide to CentOS. This tutorial is designed to help new users navigate their first steps in CentOS, an enterprise-class Linux distribution that provides a stable, predictable, and manageable platform with long-term support.

## What is CentOS?

CentOS (Community ENTerprise Operating System) is a Linux distribution that aims to provide a free, enterprise-class, community-supported computing platform functionally compatible with its upstream source, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). CentOS is known for its reliability and security, making it a popular choice for servers.

## Getting CentOS

1. **Download CentOS**: Visit the [official CentOS download page](https://www.centos.org/download/) and choose the version that suits your needs. For beginners, CentOS Stream or the latest stable version of CentOS Linux is recommended.
2. **Choose Your Installation Medium**: You can download an ISO to create a bootable USB drive or DVD, which you'll use to install CentOS on your computer or server.

## Installation

1. **Creating Bootable Media**: Use a tool like `Rufus` (for Windows) or `dd` (for Linux/Mac) to create your bootable USB drive with the CentOS ISO.
2. **Booting from Media**: Insert your bootable USB or DVD and restart your computer. You may need to enter the BIOS setup to change the boot order.
3. **Follow the Installation Wizard**: CentOS provides a graphical installer that guides you through the process. You'll select your language, time zone, installation destination, and network settings.
4. **Installation Summary**: Before proceeding, review your choices. Here, you can also select software to install. For beginners, the "Minimal Install" option is a good starting point.
5. **Complete the Installation**: Follow the prompts to complete the installation. Once done, remove your installation media and reboot your system.

## Basic Commands and System Management

- **Navigating the File System**: Use `cd` to change directories, `ls` to list files, and `pwd` to show your current directory.
- **Managing Files and Directories**: Learn to use `cp` for copying, `mv` for moving, and `mkdir` to create directories.
- **Installing Software**: CentOS uses `yum` or `dnf` for package management. To install software, use `sudo yum install package-name` or `sudo dnf install package-name`.
- **System Updates**: Keep your system up-to-date with `sudo yum update` or `sudo dnf update`.

## Next Steps

- **Configure Network Settings**: Learn to manage your system's network settings for connectivity.
- **Set Up a Web Server**: Try installing and configuring Apache or Nginx to serve web content.
- **Explore CentOS Documentation**: The [official CentOS documentation](https://docs.centos.org/) is an excellent resource for learning more about what you can do with CentOS.

Congratulations! You've taken your first steps into CentOS. As you become more comfortable, you'll find that CentOS is a powerful platform for hosting applications, services, and more.
