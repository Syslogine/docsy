## **Requirements**

- Nvidia Jetson Nano with Ubuntu installed
- A high-resolution image file (JPEG or PNG) for steganography experiments

## **Step 1: Install Required Packages**

Begin by updating the package lists and installing the necessary packages for steganography. Open a terminal on your Jetson Nano and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y steghide openjdk-8-jre
```

These commands ensure that the required steganography tools are installed on your system.

## **Step 2: Prepare Your Image**

To perform steganography, you'll need a cover image to hide your secret message. Download a high-resolution image and transfer it to your Jetson Nano's file system. For this example, assume the image is named `cover_image.jpg` and is in the `/home/user/steganography` directory on the Jetson Nano.

```bash
scp cover_image.jpg user@192.168.0.105:/home/user/steganography/
```

Adjust the filename and directory according to your specific image details.

## **Step 3: Embed a Message**

Now, you can use the `steghide` tool to embed a message within your cover image. Start by creating a text file containing the message you want to hide:

```bash
echo "This is a secret message." > secret_message.txt
```

Next, run the following command to embed the message within the cover image:

```bash
steghide --embed-filename secret_message.txt --cover-name cover_image.jpg --out steganography/output/stego_image.jpg
```

This command creates a new file called `stego_image.jpg` in the `/home/user/steganography/output` directory on your Jetson Nano, containing the embedded message.

## **Step 4: Extract the Message**

To extract the hidden message from the stego image, use the following command:

```bash
steghide --extract -sf steganography/output/stego_image.jpg -xf secret_message.txt
```

This command creates a new file called `secret_message.txt` in the current directory on your Jetson Nano, containing the extracted message.

## **Conclusion**

Congratulations! You've successfully experimented with steganography on your Nvidia Jetson Nano using Ubuntu. By following these steps, you can now embed and extract secret messages within image files. This opens up possibilities for exploring various applications of steganography in digital privacy, cryptography, and cybersecurity.
