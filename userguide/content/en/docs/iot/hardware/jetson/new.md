# Setting up the Xbox 360 v1 Camera on Jetson Nano with Ubuntu

## Overview
In this tutorial, we will cover the steps to set up the Xbox 360 v1 camera on a Nvidia Jetson Nano running Ubuntu. This camera can be used for various applications such as computer vision and machine learning.

## Requirements
- Nvidia Jetson Nano with Ubuntu installed
- USB 2.0 cable (for connecting the Xbox 360 v1 camera to the Jetson Nano)
- Xbox 360 v1 camera

## Steps
1. Connect the Xbox 360 v1 camera to the Jetson Nano using a USB 2.0 cable.
2. Open a terminal window on the Jetson Nano by clicking on the top-left corner of the screen and selecting "Terminal".
3. Update the package lists by running the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   ```
4. Install libuvc, which is required to communicate with the Xbox 360 v1 camera:
   ```
   sudo apt install libuvc-dev
   ```
5. Reboot the Jetson Nano by running the following command:
   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```
6. After the reboot, open a new terminal window and run the following command to verify that the Xbox 360 v1 camera is recognized by the system:
   ```
   ls /dev/video*
   ```
   You should see an output similar to this:
   ```
   /dev/video0
   ```
7. Run the following command to test the camera feed in VLC media player:
   ```
   vlc v4l2:// :v4l-vbi-fmt=none :v4l-chroma=h264 :v4l-chroma-cap=0 :v4l-fps=30 :v4l-input=1 :v4l-std=pal :v4l-frequency=525 :live-caching=300
   ```
8. If the camera feed is working correctly, you can proceed to develop your computer vision or machine learning applications using libraries like OpenCV.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we covered the steps to set up the Xbox 360 v1 camera on a Nvidia Jetson Nano running Ubuntu. By following these steps, you should be able to use the camera for various applications such as computer vision and machine learning.

## **Download and Install Python 3.8 on Nvidia Jetson Nano**

### **Install Dependencies**

Before we begin, let's make sure the system has the necessary tools and libraries. Open a terminal on your Nvidia Jetson Nano and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3.8-dev
```

- `sudo apt update`: Updates the package lists on your system.
- `sudo apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3.8-dev`: Installs essential build tools and libraries required for Python compilation.

### **Download and Install Python 3.8**

Now, let's download and install Python 3.8. In the same terminal, execute the following commands:

```bash
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.12/Python-3.8.12.tgz
tar xvf Python-3.8.12.tgz
cd Python-3.8.12
./configure --enable-optimizations
make -j4
sudo make altinstall
```

- `wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.12/Python-3.8.12.tgz`: Downloads the Python 3.8 source code archive.
- `tar xvf Python-3.8.12.tgz`: Extracts the contents of the archive.
- `cd Python-3.8.12`: Navigates into the extracted directory.
- `./configure --enable-optimizations`: Configures the Python build with optimizations.
- `make -j4`: Compiles Python. The `-j4` flag specifies the number of parallel processes (adjust as needed).
- `sudo make altinstall`: Installs Python with a version-specific executable (`python3.8`).

These commands download, configure, compile, and install Python 3.8 on your Nvidia Jetson Nano. This version is installed alongside the default Python versions and does not replace them.

## **Install Python 3.8 and Pip on Nvidia Jetson Nano**

### **1. Download `get-pip.py` Script**

Download the `get-pip.py` script using `wget`:

```bash
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
```

### **2. Install Python 3.8 and Pip**

Use the following command to install Python 3.8 and Pip:

```bash
python3 get-pip.py --prefix=/usr/local/python3.8
```

### **3. Update Bash Configuration**

Open the `.bashrc` file for editing:

```bash
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
```

Add the following line to the bottom of the file:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/python3.8/bin:$PATH"
```

Save the file and apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### **4. Verify Installation**

Check the Python and Pip versions to ensure successful installation:

```bash
python3.8 --version
pip3.8 --version
```

These commands download and install Python 3.8 along with Pip on your Nvidia Jetson Nano. The `.bashrc` update ensures that the new Python version is available in your system's PATH. Verify the installation by checking the versions of Python and Pip.
